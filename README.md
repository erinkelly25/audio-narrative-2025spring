This is the future site of Erin's audio narrative

I'm going to do the beach cause that is my favorite place. Im doing wave sounds, my dog running and barking, me calling his name, then a storm coming in and us leaving the beach. Storms at the beach are always the best! Smells like wet dog car door slam!

I added two of my own sounds.

Project complete: This audio narrative depicts a beach day with myself, my dog, and my brother. It starts with ocean waves and seagulls to indicate the location. Then.... a loud lighting bolt followed by rain, dog barking, and footsteps running to the car. The car is indicated by the slam door and change of rain sounds. Then all of a sudden a tornado forms- my own audio is used at this point in order for speaking parts to happen. Hope you enjoy!

Warning- headphone users beware of loud voice at the end. It is for dramtic effect!
