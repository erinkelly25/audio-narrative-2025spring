# Order

# Start in kitchen  

* Light background music for the entirety of this section
* Chatting with a co worker
* Chef calls out name for food being ready
* Sounds of the plates

# Transition to dining room  

* Kitchen music fades out and background dining room music fades in alongside chatter for the entirety of this section
* Footsteps  
* Greet table and give out food, ask if there's anything else I can get for them- they say another sprite
* Footsteps  
* Sound of cup, ice, drink pour
* Footsteps
* Here you go! Enjoy!  
* Footsteps

# Transition back to kitchen  
* Dining room music fades out, kitchen music fades back in  
* Pick up the conversation with co worker
* All sounds fade out slowly

Changing my audio idea- I'm going to do the beach cause that is my favorite place. Im doing wave sounds, my dog running and barking, me calling his name, then a storm coming in and us leaving the beach. Storms at the beach are always the best! Smells like wet dog car door slam yeaaaaa!
